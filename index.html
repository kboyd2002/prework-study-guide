          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ()</li>
          <li>when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result </li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. </li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0)</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running.</li>
          <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1.</li>
